# Chap Description :

## Confusion Matrix:
A confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model(or 'classifier') on a set of test data for which the true values are known, the confusion matrix itself is relatively simple to understand, but the related termonology can be confusing

## SVM support Vector machine

Support vector machine is a supervised machine learning that can be used for botoh classification or regression challenges, however, it is mostly used in classification problems, In the SVM algorithm, we plot each data item as a point in n-dimensional space(where n is a number of features you have) with the value of each feature being the value of a particlare coordinates
